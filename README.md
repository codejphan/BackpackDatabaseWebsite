This project was developed as a way to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It focuses on DOM manipulation, using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, and implementing features like search, filters, and sorting for a product database. It builds upon a previous version of the project, with improvements and the addition of new functionality I wanted to explore.
